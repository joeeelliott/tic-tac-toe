#tic-tac-toe game

This well-known game of tic-tac-toe was reasonably simple, taking me around 6-7 hours to complete. There is some snippets of commented out code that i had refactored and have left in for my own benefit to look back at. The many comments are also for my benefit!

Key concepts covered:
* css grid
* css flexbox
* modal
* DOM interaction
* object iteration
* modulo operator
* predicate functions
